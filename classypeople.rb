#Now that you have everyone stored in a class variable, and you gave the Person class the ability(method) to riot, letâ€™s adjust the riot method to print out all the names of the people who are rioting. So when I call Person.riot my output should be the following




class Person
  attr_accessor :name, :hair_color
  @@everyone = []

  def self.riot
    puts "#{name}are rising up!"
  end

  def save
    p @@everyone << self
  end

  def initialize(name, hair_color)
    @name = name
    @hair_color = hair_color
  end


  def sing
    puts " #{@name} is singing "
  end
end

Person.riot
